        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>With over a decade of diverse professional experience, I am the President & CEO of SNK Media Group,
          a thriving digital marketing company specializing in lead generation and brokering.
          Since founding the company in 2017, I have been instrumental in its setup, creation, and management.
          Over time, I have built a highly capable team to handle day-to-day operations, while I focus on exploring and
          implementing technology solutions to enhance company performance. As a quasi-CTO, I have been responsible for
          testing, designing, and implementing various tech integrations, particularly in the realm of real-time lead
          auction systems using API to API communications. I have a strong grasp of API interfacing, authentication,
          and communications, and have gained proficiency in Python, Django, FastAPI, and other technologies through
          my commitment to continuous learning.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I have a solid foundation for web development, but I am hoping to really round out my skills as a Full Stack
        Developer by focusing some of my efforts on Design and Styling of Web Apps</p>
        <p>Over the next few months, I am hoping to shore up or strengthen my skills in the following areas:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Design Theory</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>SASS</li>
          <li>Tailwind</li>
          <li>Figma</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd love to work for a great company like Treehouse someday, but will continue to work on improving the
          web assets and internal tools of my company in the meantime :)</p>
