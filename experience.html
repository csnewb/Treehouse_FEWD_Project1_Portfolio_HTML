        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>With over a decade of diverse professional experience, I am the President & CEO of SNK Media Group,
            a thriving digital marketing company specializing in lead generation and brokering.
            Since founding the company in 2017, I have been instrumental in its setup, creation, and management.
            Over time, I have built a highly capable team to handle day-to-day operations, while I focus on exploring and
            implementing technology solutions to enhance company performance. As a quasi-CTO, I have been responsible for
            testing, designing, and implementing various tech integrations, particularly in the realm of real-time lead
            auction systems using API to API communications. I have a strong grasp of API interfacing, authentication,
            and communications, and have gained proficiency in Python, Django, FastAPI, and other technologies through
            my commitment to continuous learning.
        </p>
        <p>Prior to my current role, I served as the Sales & Marketing Manager for Waterman Brewing Company, where I
            played a pivotal role in building and setting up the brewery. In addition to managing daily operations of
            the Tasting Room and overseeing sales for external accounts, I honed my skills in project management,
            problem-solving, and effective communication. Furthermore, my experience with the Department of Veterans
            Affairs, where I progressed to the position of Supervisor, allowed me to develop fundamental managerial
            abilities while leading teams of up to 20 employees.
        </p>
        <p>Notable projects that highlight my technical proficiency include the creation of a working prototype of a
            Ping Post software using FastAPI, replacing our existing licensed system. I have also developed a fully
            dynamic Django website framework, which enables uniformity across all our content websites, while allowing
            for remote updates via API interfaces with a Postgres database. With my versatile skill set and a strong
            foundation in business management, I am poised to make a significant impact in any technology-driven
            environment.
